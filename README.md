# Template for Django Project setup with Docker and Docker Compose

## Getting started

To get started with your new project, run the `setup_project.sh` bash file with the name of your new project.  For example, if you have a new project called "world-domination", run the following code:

```
./setup_project.sh world-domination
```

And start your plans for taking over the world!

## Building and the like

Once you have run the setup project script, run 

```
dokcer-compose build world-domination
```

This will build the required containers
